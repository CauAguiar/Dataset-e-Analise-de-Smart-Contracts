**1. List of Vulnerabilities by Category**

**High Risk:**
- **Incorrect Enforcement of Wallet Mint Limits**: The `PublicMint` function tracks the receiver's (`_to`) address for mint limits, allowing anyone to mint tokens to another address and potentially exhaust their limit, leading to denial of service.

**Medium Risk:**
- **Unsafe Minting in Mass Airdrop**: The `MassAirdrop` function uses `_mint` instead of `_safeMint`, which could result in tokens being locked in non-ERC721-compliant contracts.

**Low Risk:**
- **Reentrancy Risk in Public Mint**: Lack of reentrancy guard in `PublicMint` despite state changes before `_safeMint`, which includes a callback. However, state updates prior to minting may mitigate risk.

**Informational:**
- **Missing Event Emissions**: Critical parameter changes (price, supply, URI) do not emit events, reducing transparency.
- **Centralized Control**: Owner retains significant control over contract functions, typical but requires trust.

**Undetermined:**
- **Minting Limits Design Clarity**: The intended behavior of wallet limits (per minter vs. per receiver) needs clarification to assess correctness.

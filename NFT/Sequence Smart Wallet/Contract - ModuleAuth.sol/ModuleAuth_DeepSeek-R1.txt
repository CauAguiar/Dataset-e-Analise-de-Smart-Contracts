### Vulnerabilities Audit Report

#### High Risk
1. **Improper Signature Verification (Dependency)**  
   Relies on imported `SignatureValidator` for secure signature recovery. If susceptible to malleability or flawed recovery, unauthorized access may occur.

2. **Incorrect Image Hash Validation**  
   Abstract `_isValidImage` function's implementation determines security. Incorrect validation could allow forged configurations.

#### Medium Risk
1. **Dynamic Signature Denial-of-Service (DoS)**  
   Extremely large dynamic signatures may cause gas exhaustion during validation, disrupting contract operations.

2. **Signature Parsing Vulnerabilities**  
   Relies on `LibBytes` for parsing. Incorrect bounds checks could lead to unexpected reverts or malformed data processing.

#### Low Risk
1. **Outdated Solidity Version Use**  
   Solidity 0.7.6 lacks security improvements from newer versions, increasing potential for undiscovered compiler-level issues.

#### Undetermined Risk
1. **Dependence on Unverified Abstract Function**  
   Security hinges on correct `_isValidImage` logic in child contracts, which is not audited here.

#### Informational
1. **Non-Weighted Address Flags**  
   `FLAG_ADDRESS` includes signers in the image hash without contributing to threshold validation, requiring careful implementation in derived contracts.

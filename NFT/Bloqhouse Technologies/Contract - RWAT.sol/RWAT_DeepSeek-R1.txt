**Audit Report: RWAT Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**

---

### **High Severity**

1. **Centralized Control Over User Tokens**  
   Admins can forcibly transfer tokens between any addresses via `reclaimUnits`, bypassing user approvals and transfer restrictions.

2. **Signature Verification Relies on Single Server Key**  
   Compromised `serverPubKey` allows attackers to forge signatures and mint/claim tokens. Admins can update the key, but initial compromise remains critical.

---

### **Medium Severity**

3. **Missing Critical Event Emissions**  
   Key functions (`createAsset`, `updateAssetCap`, `setWhitelisted`) lack events, hindering off-chain monitoring and transparency.

4. **Unrestricted Asset Creation and Minting**  
   Admins can create unlimited assets (via `createAsset`) and mint tokens beyond intended limits by exploiting incremental `assetId` ranges.

5. **Admin Bypass of Transfer Restrictions**  
   Admins can disable `pausedTransfers`, enabling transfers even when paused, conflicting with user expectations of paused states.

6. **Arbitrary Whitelist Manipulation**  
   The `WHITELISTER` role can modify the whitelist, potentially bypassing transfer restrictions if compromised.

---

### **Low Severity**

7. **Gas-Intensive Batch Operations**  
   Loops in `mintUnits` and `burnUnits` risk out-of-gas errors for large batches, affecting usability.

8. **Lax Input Validation in Whitelist**  
   `setWhitelisted` does not check for zero addresses, allowing unintended whitelist entries.

---

### **Informational**

9. **Magic Numbers Without Constants**  
   Hardcoded `1_000_000_000` lacks a named constant, reducing readability.

10. **Incomplete Function Documentation**  
    Missing NatSpec comments for functions like `_mintUnits` or `_claimUnits` affect maintainability.

---

### **Undetermined**

11. **Proxy Upgrade Risks**  
    Upgradeability introduces dependency on proxy admin security, which is beyond the contract's scope but critical for overall safety.

---

**Note:** This audit assumes standard OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts and focuses on code logic. External factors (e.g., proxy admin key management) require separate evaluation.

**High-Risk Vulnerabilities:**

1. **Excessive Privileges in changeBaseURI Function**  
   The `changeBaseURI` function is marked as `external` without any access control modifiers, allowing any external actor to modify the base URI, potentially compromising the integrity of NFT metadata.

---

**Low-Risk Vulnerabilities:**

1. **Missing Valid Contract Address Check in getNFTURI**  
   The `contractAddress` parameter in `getNFTURI` is not validated, risking interactions with invalid or unintended addresses, which could result in failed calls or unexpected behavior.

---

**Undetermined Risks:**

1. **Unspecified Behavior in ICNR Interface**  
   The interface `ICNR` lacks implementation details for `getNFTURI` and `changeBaseURI`, leaving potential risks (e.g., logic flaws, unsafe operations) hidden until the actual implementation is reviewed.

---

**Informational Issues:**

1. **Pinned Solidity Compiler Version**  
   The contract specifies `pragma solidity 0.8.19`, which ensures security features of that version but restricts forward compatibility and upgrades to newer compiler versions.

**Audit Report: Vulnerabilities in TGKMainContract**

---

**High Severity:**
1. **Centralization Risk**  
   All critical functions (withdraw, token transfers) are restricted to a single owner, creating a single point of failure. Compromise of the owner's key could lead to loss of funds/NFTs.

---

**Medium Severity:**
1. **Unsafe ETH Withdrawal Mechanism**  
   Uses `transfer()` for ETH withdrawals, which may fail if the recipient is a contract with gas-intensive logic. Recommended to use `call()` with checks-effects-interactions.
2. **Incorrect ERC20 Balance Handling**  
   Assumes ERC20 token balances are static. Fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens may cause discrepancies between the actual transferred amount and the `amount` parameter.

---

**Low Severity:**
1. **Redundant NFT Ownership Check**  
   The `ownerOf` check in `transferNFT` is redundant since `safeTransferFrom` inherently verifies ownership.

---

**Informational:**
1. **Immutable Ownership**  
   No mechanism to transfer ownership, limiting flexibility post-deployment.
2. **Inaccurate Event Emission for ERC20 Transfers**  
   Events may log incorrect `amount` values for non-standard ERC20 tokens (e.g., fee-on-transfer tokens).

---

**Undetermined:**  
No undetermined risks identified.

Here is the audit report for the provided Solidity contract, categorized by vulnerability severity:

### High

1. **Improper Initialization of Context**  
   The `init` function incorrectly compares instead of initializing `_ctx.msgHash`, leaving context in an invalid state and causing unexpected reverts.

2. **Unsafe Low-Level Call Execution**  
   Arbitrary external calls in `_invokeMessageCall` lack proper gas and target validation, risking reentrancy or failures despite preventive modifiers.

---

### Medium

1. **Unaccounted Ether Deposits**  
   Direct Ether transfers to the contract bypass message validation, potentially disrupting internal accounting for message values and fees.

2. **Insufficient Gas Griefing**  
   Using `gasleft()` for message execution may lead to out-of-gas errors, forcing messages into retriable/failed states unnecessarily.

---

### Low

1. **Ether Refund Failures**  
   Using `sendEther` (likely `sendValue`) may revert if the recipient cannot accept Ether, blocking message processing.

2. **Inconsistent DestChain Validation**  
   The `sameChain` modifier enforces destination checks, but improper chain ID resolution in dependencies could allow cross-chain abuse.

---

### Informational

1. **Bypassed Message Execution for Specific Addresses**  
   Messages targeting `address(0)` or the contract itself skip invocation, potentially enabling value transfers without logic execution.

2. **Context Handling Without Initialization**  
   Initial `_ctx` state causes `context()` to revert until updated, which may confuse external integrations.

---

### Undetermined

1. **External Signal Service Reliance**  
   Security depends on the correctness of `ISignalService`, which is beyond the contract's control (e.g., proof validation or oracle manipulation).

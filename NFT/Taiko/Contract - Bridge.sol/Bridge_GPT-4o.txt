### **High**  
1. **Reentrancy Attack Risk** – The contract uses `call` to send Ether, which can be reentered if the receiving contract is malicious.  
2. **Access Control Issues** – Some functions lack proper access restrictions, potentially allowing unintended users to execute them.  
3. **Incorrect Initialization** – The `init` function incorrectly uses `==` instead of `=` when setting `_ctx.msgHash`. This prevents proper initialization.  
4. **Gas Limit Handling Issues** – The contract does not properly verify gas limits, potentially leading to failed transactions or vulnerability to gas exhaustion attacks.  
5. **Lack of Rate-Limiting** – There is no mechanism to prevent spam or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on `sendMessage` or `processMessage`.  

### **Medium**  
6. **Untrusted External Calls** – The contract calls unverified external addresses (`message.to.call{}`), which could lead to execution of malicious contracts.  
7. **Insufficient Validation of `message.destChainId`** – The contract allows sending messages to invalid or unsupported chains without full validation.  
8. **Unverified Merkle Proofs** – The contract depends on `_proveSignalReceived`, but does not enforce strong validation on provided proofs.  

### **Low**  
9. **Lack of Event Emission for Critical Actions** – Some state-changing operations (e.g., `recallMessage`) do not emit relevant events, making it harder to track changes.  
10. **Unnecessary `assert` Statement** – The `assert(message.from != address(this))` statement could be redundant and should be replaced with proper validation.  
11. **Potential Front-Running Risks** – The contract does not implement any protection against transaction ordering manipulation, which could lead to MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks.  

### **Informational**  
12. **Improper Commenting** – Some comments in the contract do not match the function logic, which could mislead developers during audits.  
13. **Use of Magic Constants** – Hardcoded values like `uint256 internal constant PLACEHOLDER = type(uint256).max` should be replaced with named constants for clarity.  
14. **Redundant Checks** – Several functions perform unnecessary checks, like rechecking `message.srcChainId` multiple times.  

### **Undetermined**  
15. **Lack of Full Specification for External Calls** – Without verifying the implementation of `ISignalService` and `IRecallableSender`, it is unclear whether they introduce additional security risks.

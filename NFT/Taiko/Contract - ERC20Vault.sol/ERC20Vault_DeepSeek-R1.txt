**1. Vulnerabilities List:**

**High:**
- **Unchecked Ether Transfer:** Use of `sendEther` without verifying the return value may result in silent failures and lost Ether.
- **Bridged Token Access Control:** Reliance on external BridgedERC20's `mint`/`burn` without ensuring proper access controls in the token contract.
- **Chain ID Truncation Risk:** Casting `block.chainid` (uint256) to uint64 may truncate values on chains with large IDs.

**Medium:**
- **Token Metadata Volatility:** Canonical token data (e.g., `decimals`) retrieved dynamically could change post-registration, causing inconsistencies.
- **Front-Runnable Token Deployment:** Race conditions during bridged token deployment might allow unintended overwrites if not properly restricted.
- **Insecure Message Recall Handling:** `onMessageRecalled` assumes caller validation via `checkRecallMessageContext`, risking unauthorized recalls if misconfigured.

**Low:**
- **Bridged Token Blacklist Bypass:** Blacklist enforcement only at send-time, allowing pre-blacklisted tokens to remain in circulation.
- **Symbol/Name Collision:** Different canonical tokens with identical symbols/names could cause mapping conflicts.

**Undetermined:**
- **BridgedERC20 Implementation Risks:** Security depends on external `BridgedERC20` contract's correctness (e.g., migration logic, ownership checks).

**Informational:**
- **Reentrancy Protections:** Non-reentrant modifiers correctly applied to critical functions.
- **Upgradability Gaps:** Reserved storage slots (`__gap`) used for upgradeability, following UUPS patterns.

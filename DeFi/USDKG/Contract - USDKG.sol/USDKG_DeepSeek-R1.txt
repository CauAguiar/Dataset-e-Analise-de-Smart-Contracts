### High Risk Vulnerabilities:
- **Blacklist Bypass for Recipients**  
  Transfers do not check if the recipient is blacklisted, allowing blacklisted users to receive tokens.

- **ERC20 Approve Front-Running**  
  The `approve` function is susceptible to front-running attacks, allowing old allowances to be used before updating.

- **Centralized Control Risks**  
  Owner and compliance addresses have excessive privileges (e.g., minting, burning, pausing, blacklisting) without safeguards against compromise.

---

### Medium Risk Vulnerabilities:
- **Missing Transfer Event on Mint**  
  The `issue` function mints tokens but does not emit a `Transfer` event, breaking ERC20 compatibility expectations.

- **Insufficient Fee Precision Handling**  
  Fee calculation truncates decimal values due to integer division, potentially leading to cumulative precision loss.

- **Unrestricted Allowance Update Logic**  
  The `transferFrom` function allows spending even if the allowance is not explicitly set to `type(uint256).max`, risking unexpected behavior.

---

### Low Risk Vulnerabilities:
- **Immutable Ownership**  
  No mechanism exists to transfer ownership, creating a single point of failure if the owner's key is compromised.

- **Lack of Address Validation in Blacklist**  
  Blacklist functions do not prevent zero-address modifications, though no direct exploit exists.

---

### Informational:
- **Non-Standard ERC20 Implementation**  
  Custom fee logic and blacklist features deviate from the standard ERC20 template, which may affect integrations.

- **Potential Governance Risks**  
  Centralized functions (e.g., `issue`, `destroyBlackFunds`) rely on trusted actors, which is inherent to the design but could require documentation.

---

### Undetermined:
- **Fee Parameter Safety**  
  The impact of `basisPointsRate` depends on future use; enabling fees could introduce risks if not audited again.

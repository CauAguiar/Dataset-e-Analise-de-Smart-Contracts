**Audit Report: WstETHOracle Contract Vulnerabilities**

---

### **High Severity**

1. **Incorrect Price Assumption (Assumes 1 stETH = 1 WETH)**  
   The oracle assumes stETH and WETH are always pegged 1:1. If stETH depegs (e.g., due to protocol issues), the reported price for wstETH will be inaccurate, leading to systemic risks in dependent protocols.

2. **Potential Decimal Scaling Mismatch**  
   The calculation assumes `RESILIENT_ORACLE` returns WETH’s price scaled to 1e18. If the external oracle uses a different scaling (e.g., 1e8), the computed wstETH price will be incorrect, causing significant valuation errors.

---

### **Medium Severity**

1. **External Oracle Dependency**  
   The contract relies entirely on `RESILIENT_ORACLE` for WETH’s price. Compromise or misconfiguration of the external oracle directly impacts the accuracy of wstETH pricing.

2. **Lack of Price Freshness Check**  
   No validation of the timestamp from the external oracle’s price data, risking reliance on stale prices (e.g., during oracle downtime or delays).

---

### **Low Severity**

1. **Inefficient Error Reporting**  
   Reverts with a string error message (`"wrong wstETH address"`) instead of gas-efficient custom errors. Increases gas costs for invalid calls.

---

### **Informational**

1. **Centralized Dependency on External Contracts**  
   Correct functionality depends on the integrity and proper configuration of external contracts (e.g., `STETH`, `RESILIENT_ORACLE`). Changes or failures in these dependencies may compromise the oracle.

---

### **Undetermined**

No undetermined risks identified in the provided code.

---

**Summary**:  
The primary risks stem from assumptions about asset pegs and scaling, alongside reliance on external oracles. Mitigation requires validating price dependencies, ensuring decimal consistency, and implementing freshness checks.

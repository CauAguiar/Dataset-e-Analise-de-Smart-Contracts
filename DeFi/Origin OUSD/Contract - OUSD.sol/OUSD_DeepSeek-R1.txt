**1. List of Vulnerabilities and Issues**

**High Severity:**
- **Division by Zero in Supply Adjustment**: The `changeSupply` function may divide by zero if `totalSupply - nonRebasingSupply` is zero, causing transaction reverts or contract lockup.
- **Unchecked Yield Delegation State Transitions**: Improper handling of delegation state transitions could corrupt account states or enable unauthorized yield redirection.

**Medium Severity:**
- **Rounding Errors in Credit Conversions**: Use of rounding in `_balanceToRebasingCredits` without proper validation may lead to cumulative balance inaccuracies.
- **Front-Runnable Approvals**: The `approve` function lacks protection against front-running attacks when modifying existing non-zero allowances.
- **Forced Non-Rebasing Migration for Contracts**: Automatic opt-out of rebasing for contract accounts may cause unexpected behavior if contracts assume rebasing participation.

**Low Severity:**
- **Deprecated Storage Variable**: Presence of unused `__deprecated_isUpgraded` storage variable indicates legacy code, risking future upgrade conflicts.

**Informational:**
- **Upgradeable Storage Gaps**: Use of storage gaps (`_gap[]`) for upgradeability introduces risks if future upgrades mishandle storage layout.
- **Complex Rebasing Logic**: High complexity in rebasing and delegation mechanisms increases audit difficulty and risk of undetected edge cases.

**Undetermined:**
- **Governance Privilege Escalation**: Potential risks in the `Governable` parent contract (not shown) could allow unauthorized governance actions if privileges are misconfigured.

**1. List of Vulnerabilities and Issues:**

**High:**
- *No high-severity vulnerabilities identified.*

**Medium:**
- *No medium-severity vulnerabilities identified.*

**Low:**
- *No low-severity vulnerabilities identified.*

**Undetermined:**
- *No undetermined risks identified.*

**Informational:**
1. **ERC20 Approval Race Condition**  
   The standard `approve` function is vulnerable to front-running. Use `increaseAllowance`/`decreaseAllowance` to mitigate.

2. **Public Burn Function**  
   The `burn` function allows unrestricted token destruction by any holder, which is permissible but should be intentionally documented.

3. **Fixed Token Supply**  
   The total supply is minted once during deployment, with no post-deployment minting. Ensures immutability but limits flexibility.

4. **OpenZeppelin Dependency**  
   Relies on audited libraries, but outdated versions (if used) may introduce risks. Verify dependency versions.

5. **Large Initial Supply**  
   Minting `1_000_000_000 ether` tokens (1e27 units) is permissible but could impact tokenomics if not intentional.

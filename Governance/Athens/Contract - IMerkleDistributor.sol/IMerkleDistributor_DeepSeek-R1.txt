**Audit Report: Vulnerabilities in MerkleDistributor Interface**

**High Severity:**
- **Improper Access Control in `claim` Function**: The interface does not enforce that the caller (`msg.sender`) must match the `account` parameter. If the implementation lacks this check, third parties could claim tokens on behalf of valid recipients.
- **Reentrancy Risk in `claim` Function**: The interface does not specify safeguards (e.g., checks-effects-interactions pattern or reentrancy guards), leaving the implementation vulnerable to reentrancy attacks during token transfers.

**Undetermined Severity:**
- **Merkle Proof Validation Flaws**: Correct verification of the Merkle proof is critical for security, but the interface does not detail the implementation, making vulnerabilities possible if proofs are improperly validated.
- **Mutable Merkle Root**: If the implementation allows post-deployment modification of the Merkle root (via an unexposed function), unauthorized claims could occur.

**Informational:**
- **Event Emission Consistency**: The `Claimed` event must be emitted after successful claims to ensure transparent tracking.
- **Input Validation Gaps**: Parameters such as `amount` should be validated (e.g., non-zero) in the implementation to prevent invalid claims.

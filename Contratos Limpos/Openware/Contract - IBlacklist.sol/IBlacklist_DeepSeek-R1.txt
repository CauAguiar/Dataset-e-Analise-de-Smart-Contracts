**High:**
1. **Centralized Control Risk** - All critical functions (blacklist, removeBlacklisted, burnBlacklisted) depend on a single role (`COMPLIANCE_ROLE`), contradicting the stated separation-of-duties principle.  
2. **Missing Access Control Separation** - No distinct roles for blacklisting vs. burning, allowing a single entity to control both actions.  
3. **Unvalidated Burn Targets** - The `burnBlacklisted` function lacks explicit validation (in this interface) to ensure the target is blacklisted before burning.  

**Medium:**  
1. **Inconsistent Event Logging** - The `BlacklistedBurnt` event includes an `amount` parameter, but the interface does not define how this value is determined or enforced.  

**Low:**  
1. **Incomplete Role Management Definition** - The interface does not specify how `COMPLIANCE_ROLE` is assigned/revoked, risking opaque governance in implementations.  

**Undetermined:**  
1. **Lack of Safeguards Against Abuse** - No visible mechanisms (e.g., timelocks, multi-sig) to prevent malicious use of compliance functions. Actual risk depends on implementation.  

**Informational:**  
1. **Documentation-Implementation Mismatch** - Comments emphasize separating roles for blacklisting and burning, but the interface uses a unified role, creating ambiguity.

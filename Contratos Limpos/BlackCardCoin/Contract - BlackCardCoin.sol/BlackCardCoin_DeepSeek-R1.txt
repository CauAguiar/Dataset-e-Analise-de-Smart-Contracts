**1. List of Vulnerabilities and Issues:**

**High Severity:**

- **None Identified**  
  No critical vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, or incorrect access control were found in the current implementation.

---

**Medium Severity:**

- **Single-Step Ownership Transfer**  
  The `setOwner` function allows immediate ownership transfer without a two-step process (e.g., propose/accept), risking accidental permanent loss of control if an invalid address is used.

---

**Low Severity:**  

- **Hardcoded Reserve Addresses**  
  Liquidity and rewards addresses are immutable constants. If these addresses are incorrectly configured or compromised, tokens may become permanently inaccessible.  

---

**Informational:**  

- **Potential Allowance Race Condition**  
  The `approve` function follows the ERC20 standard but is susceptible to front-running when updating allowances (a known ERC20 design limitation).  
- **Centralization Risks**  
  The contract owner can transfer ownership, but lacks mechanisms for decentralized governance. Initial reserves are fully controlled by hardcoded addresses.  
- **Missing Two-Step Ownership Transfer**  
  Ownership changes occur in a single transaction, increasing the risk of human error in address handling.  

---

**Undetermined Severity:**  

- **None Identified**  
  No issues requiring further context or external information were identified.

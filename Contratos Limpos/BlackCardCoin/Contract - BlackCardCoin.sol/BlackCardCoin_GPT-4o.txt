### **High Severity Vulnerabilities**
1. **Missing Constructor Supply Assignment**  
   - The contract does not allocate tokens to the contract deployer in the constructor, which may result in an unintended token distribution.

2. **Lack of Access Control on Token Minting**  
   - There is no function to mint new tokens, but if one is added in the future without proper access control, it could lead to unauthorized minting.

### **Medium Severity Vulnerabilities**
3. **Hardcoded Owner Address**  
   - The `_owner` is initially set to a specific address, which is not assigned dynamically. This reduces flexibility and could be problematic if ownership needs to be transferred securely.

4. **Insecure `transferFrom` Implementation**  
   - The `transferFrom` function does not correctly handle the case where `allowance` is set to `type(uint256).max`, which is a common optimization in ERC20 tokens to save gas.

### **Low Severity Vulnerabilities**
5. **Lack of Events for Balance Changes in Internal `_transfer` Function**  
   - The `_transfer` function updates balances but does not emit an event when balances are decreased, making it harder to track fund movements off-chain.

6. **Use of `require` for Errors Without Custom Error Messages**  
   - Instead of using Solidity's new custom errors (since Solidity 0.8.4), the contract relies on `require` with string messages, which increases gas costs.

### **Informational Issues**
7. **Missing `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` Functions**  
   - Standard ERC20 implementations include these functions to prevent potential race conditions when updating allowances.

8. **No `Ownable` or Role-Based Access Control**  
   - The contract does not use OpenZeppelinâ€™s `Ownable` or `AccessControl`, which would provide a more structured approach to managing ownership and privileges.

Would you like me to suggest fixes for these vulnerabilities?

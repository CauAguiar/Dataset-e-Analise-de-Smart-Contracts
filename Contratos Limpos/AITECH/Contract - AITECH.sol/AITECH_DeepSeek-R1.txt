**Audit Report for AITECH Token Contract**

---

### **High**  
*No high-risk vulnerabilities identified.*

---

### **Medium**  
*No medium-risk vulnerabilities identified.*

---

### **Low**  
*No low-risk vulnerabilities identified.*

---

### **Undetermined**  
1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Potential regulatory risks (e.g., token classification) are not addressed in the code but depend on external factors.

---

### **Informational**  
1. **Initial Supply Minting**: All tokens are minted to the deployer during deployment, requiring secure handling of the deployer's private key.  
2. **Burnable Tokens**: The contract inherits `ERC20Burnable`, enabling token holders to permanently destroy their tokens, affecting supply dynamics.  
3. **OpenZeppelin Dependencies**: Ensure that imported OpenZeppelin libraries are up-to-date and audited.  
4. **Name/Symbol Consistency**: The token name and symbol are identical ("AITECH"), which is technically valid but may conflict with frontend/dApp expectations.  
5. **Fixed Supply**: No additional minting functions exist post-deployment, enforcing a capped supply (subject to burnable reductions).

*Note: The contract is minimal and leverages audited standards, but operational risks (e.g., key management) should be mitigated externally.*

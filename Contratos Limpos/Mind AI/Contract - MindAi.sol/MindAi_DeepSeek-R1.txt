**Audit Report for `MA` Token Contract**

---

### **High Severity**

1. **Centralized Control of Initial Supply**  
   The entire token supply is minted to a fixed address during deployment. If this address is compromised, it could lead to total supply loss or misuse. No decentralized ownership mechanism (e.g., multisig) or future minting restrictions are implemented.

---

### **Informational**

1. **Fixed Initial Supply Allocation**  
   The contract mints all tokens to a single hardcoded address during construction. While not a direct vulnerability, this approach carries deployment risks (e.g., incorrect address input) and centralizes control over the entire token supply.

---

### **Notes**  
- The contract uses Solidity 0.8.26 and OpenZeppelinâ€™s audited libraries, mitigating risks like integer overflow and reentrancy.  
- The lack of post-deployment privileged functions reduces attack surfaces.  
- Ensure the recipient address (`0xB66C1...`) is secure and correctly configured (e.g., a multisig wallet).  

--- 

**Conclusion**  
The code is minimal and leverages secure patterns but depends entirely on the security of the initial mint address. No critical code flaws detected beyond centralization concerns.
